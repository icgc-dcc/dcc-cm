# Description: 
#   This is DCC portal configuration file for varnish 3.0.4. Used for parameters and command line arguments. 
#
#   /etc/init.d/varnish expects the variables $DAEMON_OPTS, $NFILES and $MEMLOCK
#   to be set from this shell script fragment.
#
# Notes: 
#   When you change this, you need to run service varnish restart for the changes to take effect. 
#
#   If systemd is installed, this file is obsolete and ignored.  You will
#   need to copy /lib/systemd/system/varnish.service to /etc/systemd/system/ and
#   edit that file.
#
#   On RedHat-based OSâ€™s, this is kept in /etc/sysconfig/varnish instead.
#
#   Most Varnish-installations use two configuration-files. One of them is used by the operating system 
#   to start Varnish (this), while the other contains the VCL.
#
